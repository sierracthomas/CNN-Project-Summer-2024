    "For the first part of the summer, we'll be training a neural network to recognize handwritten digits. We'll be doing this for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This will help us to learn Python, a programming language that is incredibly important in day-to-day research and science. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. This will help us learn to use *libraries*, or Python code that has been written for us to use. This way, we don't have to start from the ground-up! We'll use Numerical Python, or \"NumPy\", which will handle math and some other functions for us. We'll also use PyTorch, written as `torch`, which will help us to load images, create and train a neural network, and test how accurate the NN is.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Although the handwriting-recognition (HR-REC) tutorial is already written, we don't have a tutorial for training the neural network on neutrino interactions. We'll need your help with this, as scientific research doesn't often come with instructions!\n",
