# CNN-Project-Summer-2024

***

Contents: 

`main` - contains `functions.py` (for black-box functions like plotting the confusion matrix) and `train_cnn.py` (should we make this a jupyter notebook?)

`resources` - contains a `README` with links for info

`datasets` - contains a way to get the MNIST dataset and the future dataset with pixelated event topologies

***

we can have them fork the repository on their own github page and submit pull requests on separate branches with their CNN work + own (hidden layers, num epochs...) configurations?
